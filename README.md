# Binary Classification with Neuron Network
This project performs various machine learning tasks on a dataset with 19020 samples and 11 attributes. Demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms to a dataset, allowing the comparison of their performance using classification reports. Additionally, it conducts a hyperparameter search for a neural network model.
The project including:
  - Importing Libaries
  - Dataset Loading and Preprocessing
  - Split dataset
  - Data Scaling and Oversampling
  - k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) Classifier
  - Naive Bayes Classifier
  - Logistic Regression Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
  - Neurol Network (Deep Learning) Classifier
  

## Dataset:
Data are MC generated to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in an atmospheric Cherenkov telescope
